## About me

I started my first job in IT in 2001, joined a small company in Volzhsky, Volgograd region, Russia as a sysadmin, was doing network support and Active Directory maintenance and support.

In 2004 became a web-developer, did lots of javascript/html/css/php then some .NET. Had lots of fun supporting IE5.5, IE6, IE, Opera 7+ :)

Assembled my first team in 2007, but was still also coding at the time.

Since 2016 I stopped coding professionally, doing it only occasionally now — I became a fulltime EM / teamlead.

I also started mentoring teamleads somewhere around 2017.

Teaching, mentoring, lecturing — essentially helping others — is my passion.

All my talks can be found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFtS8Ah0wZvWS37oveJ0-D5K6V7GWUpqY).

Sometimes companies approach me and ask to give talks for their peeps, which I of course love to do. I was giving talks in Rocketbank, Badoo, Am-tech, mail.ru, Pixonic, Softwise, DouDouGames.

I believe that being as transparent as possible is _the way_, so I try putting all my thoughts in [the github repo](https://github.com/sharovatov/teamlead).
