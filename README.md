## About me

I started my first job in IT in 2001 as a system administrator in a small company in Volzhsky (Volgograd region, Russia). In 2004 became a web-developer, did lots of javascript/html/css/php and had all the fun of supporting IE5.5, IE6 and Opera 7+. Later, I did some programming in C#, PHP and C++. 

I assembled my first team in 2007, and since then I was studying and practicing management too. Since 2017, I started sharing my knowledge and mentoring engineering managers.

Teaching, mentoring, lecturing — essentially helping others — is my true passion.
